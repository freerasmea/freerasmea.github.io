title: About The Case
---

In the early morning of Tuesday, October 22nd, 2013, sixty-five year old Associate Director of the Arab American Action Network (AAAN), **Rasmea Yousef Odeh**, was arrested at her home by agents from the Department of Homeland Security.  She was indicted in federal court that same morning, charge with Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization, an allegation based on answers she gave on a 20-year-old immigration application. On November 10th 2014, without a full and fair trial Rasmea Odeh was found guilty. She has been detained pending sentencing at the St. Clair County Jail in Port Huron, Michigan.

Rasmea, who has made it her life's work to serve and help empower Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim families, is the victim of another politically-motivated witch-hunt by our federal law enforcement agencies, which continue to violate the civil rights of Arabs and Muslims with impunity, particularly those who are critical of U.S. support for Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people.

Rasmea is a leading member of Chicago's Arab and Muslim communities, and her decade of service in the U.S. has changed the lives of thousands of people, particularly disenfranchised Arab women and their families.  She has been with the AAAN since 2004, and is responsible for the management of day-to-day operations and the coordination of its Arab Women's Committee, which has a membership of close to 600 and leads the organization's work in the areas of defending civil liberties and immigrant rights. She is a mentor to hundreds of immigrant women, as well as many members of the AAAN's staff and board, and is a well-known and respected organizer throughout Chicagoland, the U.S., and the world.

Earlier this year, Rasmea received the "Outstanding Community Leader Award" from the Chicago Cultural Alliance, which described her as a woman who has "dedicated over 40 years of her life to the empowerment of Arab women, first in her homes of Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon, where she was an activist and practicing attorney, and then the past 10 years in Chicago."

Rasmea is a community icon who recently completed a Master's degree in Criminal Justice from Governors State University. She overcame vicious torture by Israeli authorities while imprisoned in Palestine in the 70s, and is a proud reminder of the millions of Palestinians who have not given up organizing for their rights of liberation, equality, and return.

It is appalling that our government is now attempting to imprison her once again.  Condemn the attack on this important elder, Rasmea Yousef Odeh, as well as the broader pattern of persecuting Arabs and Muslims who are outstanding and outspoken leaders in their communities throughout the U.S.   Take action by turning the page!
