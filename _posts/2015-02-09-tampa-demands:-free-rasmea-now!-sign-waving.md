## [Tampa Demands: Free Rasmea Now! - Sign Waving](https://www.facebook.com/events/658909987553330/)

CSFR Tampa will be joining the National Week of Action to defend Rasmea Odeh, a Palestinian activist facing deportation and up to ten years in jail based on trumped-up immigration charges.

We demand #FreeRasmeaNow! We will be holding signs in solidarity with Rasmea and speaking out against the great injustice committed against her and against the repression of Palestinians and activists.
