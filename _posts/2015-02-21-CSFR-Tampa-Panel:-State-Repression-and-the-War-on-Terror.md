## [CSFR Tampa Panel: State Repression and the War on Terror](https://www.facebook.com/events/444820445667294/)
Saturday, February 21 at 4:00pm

Committee to Stop FBI Repression - Tampa will be hosting a panel discussion on state repression and the persecution of Arab- and Muslim-Americans in the US, and how it relates to the War on Terror internationally. This event will also address local conditions of and how to protect yourself against FBI repression. 

The panel will include speakers with a moderated Q&A. We will also link back the issues discussed to our work with CSFR, including an upcoming protest in solidarity with Rasmea Odeh, a Palestinian woman unjustly convicted of immigration charges based on a confession coerced through torture, and Call-in Day: Keep FBI Out of Mosques, to demand that the FBI stop recruiting informants from Tampa mosques.
