Rasmea Odeh is a 67 year old Palestinian American community leader who was tortured by the Israeli government in 1969. In 2014 Rasmea was unjustly convicted of one count of Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization and sentenced to 18 months in prison and deportation. The appeals court heard oral arguments on October 14th and we are currently awaiting the decision. Learn about her struggle against systemic targeting of Arabs and Muslims, and ways to support her defense.
