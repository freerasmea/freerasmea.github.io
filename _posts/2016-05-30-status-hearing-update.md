## Rasmea Defense Committee update to the mobilization for Detroit June 13th! 

Just last week, Judge Gershwin Drain informed Rasmea's attorneys that the June 13th status hearing will take place in chambers, which means it will not be in open court, and which also means that it may be a very short (between an hour and two, possibly less) proceeding.

Nevertheless, the defense committee will still be organizing a rally in front of the courthouse while the closed meeting between the judge, attorneys, and Rasmea is in session. 

Supporters from Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, and Ann Arbor, at least, have committed to continue to mobilize, so [sign up RIGHT NOW](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ru4N5poBF6KsKCmq7ufDuNAGKX7dkoaVKGMFMsvNiaw/viewform?c=0&w=1) to help us win #Justice4Rasmea!
 
**WHEN: Monday, June 13th, 2016
<br>Rally outside the courthouse at 10 AM Eastern Time**

**WHERE: U.S. Courthouse for the Eastern District of Michigan
<br>231 W. Lafayette Blvd.
<br>Detroit, Michigan 48226**


**Background and more info:**

A little over two months ago, all of you supporters helped Rasmea and her defense committee win a huge victory, as the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals sent her case back to trial judge Gershwin Drain, saying he had wrongfully barred the testimony of a torture expert that was critical to the defense.  At the trial, Rasmea was not allowed to tell the entire story of her arrest and forced confession by the Israelis in Palestine in 1969, when she endured over three weeks of vicious sexual, physical, and psychological torture at the hands of the Israeli military.

Rasmea suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because of this torture, which, according to world renowned psychologist, Dr. Mary Fabri, caused her to suppress the horrible recollection of the arrest when she answered questions on her immigration application in the U.S.  These allegedly false answers led to her unjust conviction in the politically-motivated trial in 2014, which in turn led to her being sentenced last year to 18 months in prison and deportation.  She is currently living and working in Chicago, free while fighting the conviction. 
 
Judge Drain excluded Dr. Fabri’s testimony from the trial, and disallowed any evidence about the rape and torture.  Now, after the appeals court decision, the judge must determine new legal avenues to exclude the expert testimony.  If he cannot, Rasmea may be granted a new trial!
 
Make your travel plans now to be with the Rasmea Defense Committee, [U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN)](http://uspcn.org/), [Committee to Stop FBI Repression](http://www.stopfbi.net/), and the Coalition to Protect People’s Rights—in support of our [hero](http://justice4rasmea.org/about/)!
 
**For those attending the rally:**

Please be at the courthouse at 10 AM Eastern for the rally and picket. Posters and banners will be provided.  You can bring your Palestinian flags!  

**Please do not volunteer to speak to any media or press in attendance.** The defense committee has a media team made up of the only people authorized to speak to the press.

After the closed session in judge's chambers, lead defense attorney **Michael Deutsch** will address the media and Rasmea’s supporters, and then we will hear from a number of solidarity speakers, including **Frank Chapman**, Field Organizer for the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression; a representative from CSFR; organizers with **Students for Justice in Palestine** and the **#BlackLivesMatter** movement, respectively; members of the Detroit / Dearborn community; and more.
