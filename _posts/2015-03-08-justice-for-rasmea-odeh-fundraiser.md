**Join Phyllis Bennis on International Women's Day to honor Palestinian activist Rasmea Odeh and help raise funds for her defense.**

On November 10, 2014, Rasmea was found guilty of one count of Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization. She is facing deportation and 5-7 years in jail on these trumped up immigration charges. Rasmea's case is part of a larger campaign against Palestinian leaders, institutions, and community members, as well as an example of government repression waged against social justice activists. 

Though Rasmea has been unjustly convicted, her struggle is far from over as an appeals process will begin after sentencing on March 12. Rasmea has made so many contributions to the cause of freedom and now needs your support to help her get justice. 

_Snacks and drinks will be served. Palestinian musician Fuad Foty will be performing._
