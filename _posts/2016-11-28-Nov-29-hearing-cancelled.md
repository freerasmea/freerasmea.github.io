## URGENT UPDATE: Rasmea Odeh's hearing for tomorrow CANCELLED!

The Rasmea Defense Committee just now got word from Rasmea's defense attorneys that Judge Gershwin Drain cancelled the _Daubert_ hearing that was scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, November 29th, in Detroit.

We have no idea what this means, besides the simple fact that the judge will be rendering a written decision without hearing arguments.

We are very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause those incredible supporters who have committed to travel to Detroit from all across the country. Please understand that we just received this information an hour ago.

Again, we have no more information besides the cancellation order, but media can call Hatem Abudayyeh at 773.301.4108 if necessary.
