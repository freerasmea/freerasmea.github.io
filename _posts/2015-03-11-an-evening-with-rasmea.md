## [ An Evening with Rasmea: Fundraiser in Support of Community Leader and Activist](https://www.facebook.com/events/847952345270970/848797825186422/)
	
**When: Wednesday, March 11, 7:00pm - 9:00pm EDT
Where: Arab American National Museum, 13624 Michigan Ave, Dearborn, Michigan 48126**


Join us in welcoming Rasmea Odeh to Detroit on March 11 at the Arab American Museum Annex. We are hosting a fundraiser in celebration of the resilience of Palestinian community leader Rasmea Odeh. All proceeds will go directly towards her legal defense fund. 

Rasmea Odeh is a 67 year old Palestinian-American community leader in Chicago. Last October, Rasmea was indicted for allegedly falsifying information on her immigration application, accusations based on information gained through torture in an Israeli jail nearly 20 years ago. 

This past November, Rasmea was unlawfully found guilty on these charges, in an unfair trial where the judge did not allow her to present any evidence on the weeks of torture she endured at the hands of the Israeli military. 

After 1 month imprisonment, where she spent weeks in solitary confinement without explanation, she was released on a $50,000 bond on December 11.

Rasmea's sentencing date is scheduled for this Thursday, March 12 at 10 am, Detroit Federal Courthouse. Please join us coming together and supporting her in her stand against injustice.

_**Suggested $5-10 donation at the door.**_
