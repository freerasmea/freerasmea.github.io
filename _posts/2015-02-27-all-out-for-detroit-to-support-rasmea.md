We are committed to filling the courtroom, and an overflow room, on Rasmea's sentencing day on March 12th.  We will also organize a picket in front of the courthouse one hour before the hearing.

To continue to show the support for Rasmea that we did throughout her trial and pre-trial hearings, we need you in Detroit!

Thursday, March 12th, 2015, at 10 AM EST (hearing starts at 11 AM EST)

231 W. Lafayette Blvd., downtown Detroit

Please join us on Thursday, March 12th, in Detroit for Rasmea's sentencing hearing.  Rasmea was unjustly convicted in November of last year, and the prosecution is now asking for an enhanced sentence of 5-7 years in prison.  (The vast majority of those convicted of Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization are sentenced to no more than 21 months.) 

Rasmea's defense attorneys are arguing that she shouldn't be imprisoned for even one more day, and over 70 important leaders of unions and community-based, faith-based, civil rights, and student organizations, as well as prominent academics and activists, who all wrote letters of leniency to Judge Gershwin Drain, agree. 

In addition, it must be made clear that Rasmea will be appealing the conviction regardless of the outcome of the sentencing, so visit the national Rasmea Defense Committee's new website at www.justice4rasmea.org to help us fundraise for the appeal and learn of other action steps you can take.

Rasmea spoke with her supporters across the country by livestream a number of times in the past few weeks, and fundraisers and educational events were organized in New York City, Minneapolis, Chicago, San Francisco, Tucson, Tampa, St. Lake City, Gainesville, Miami, Phoenix, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, Albuquerque, Seattle, Albany, NY, and other cities.  More fundraisers are scheduled for Fishers, IN, and Chicago this coming week. (See a full list of events here.)  

There is still much more organizing to be done!

Register here to join us in Detroit on March 12, visit www.justice4rasmea.org for more information, or email justice4rasmea@uspcn.org with any questions.
