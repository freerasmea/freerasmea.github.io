Our dear Rasmea Odeh will be leaving the U.S. for Jordan tomorrow, Tuesday, September 19th, 2017.

She was officially sentenced in August by Judge Gershwin Drain, who did not allow her to make a final statement in open court, but the Rasmea Defense Committee published that statement [here](http://justice4rasmea.org/news/2017/08/18/court-statement/), and now we are asking supporters to join us at O'Hare Airport on September 19th for Rasmea's final send-off.

This is our last opportunity to say goodbye before she is forced to depart the U.S. after an almost four-year legal and political struggle, a struggle in which the defense committee [organized day and night](http://justice4rasmea.org/news/2017/03/23/rasmea-accepts-plea-deal/) for #Justice4Rasmea, educated thousands about her case and the cause of Palestinian liberation, and made the name Rasmea synonymous with all of the other major social justice fights in the country.

As she and the defense committee have said many times, regardless of where she lands, Rasmea will never stop working and organizing for justice and for the liberation of Palestine and other oppressed communities.

On September 19th, she will be moving on to the next chapter of her life, and we invite you to be with us that day.

**WHEN:** Tuesday, September 19th, 2017, from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM

**WHERE:** Short-term parking lot at O'Hare Airport International Terminal 5
