## Rasmea Odeh Live Stream Events Available for the Week of Action:

The National Week of Action to Defend Rasmea is taking place the week February 9-15

We are organizing two live-stream appearances by Rasmea Odeh to take place around the week of action. These live streams are an opportunity to have Rasmeaâ€™s presence at events around the country. 

**FORMAT:**
Rasmea will give a prepared talk and take questions that are submitted via chat or email.  

The proposal is that her talk would be part of a program that includes at least one local speaker on next steps in defense work but it will also work within a program on Political Repression, Palestine, etc.  

**WHEN:**
One live stream is scheduled for 6:30 pm CT, 7:30 ET Friday February 13,2015

The second live stream is not yet scheduled.  We are looking for a live stream time and day that can work well for West Coast events though it will be available to all. Email event proposals to s[topfbi@gmail.com](mailto:stopfbi@gmail.com) (Re: Rasmea Livestream).

**HOW:**
Your event location will need an active internet connection and a computer with speakers for viewing the stream. If you expect a lot of people and have access to a digital projector and screen that can be a nice addition. 

If you wish to ask questions from your location it may be more convenient to have a second device with chat or email capability ie. Smartphone, laptop, tablet etc.

The live stream will be broadcast on the StopFBInet You Tube Channel. Confirm the broadcast link and other day of event information by emailing the organizers at [stopfbi@gmail.com](mailto:stopfbi@gmail.com) (Re: Rasmea Livestream).
